I recently used  [Classeur](https://app.classeur.io) to write up a solution for a coding test.I found the interface to be very clean and convenient.
I especially wanted to make use of MathJax style expressions and equations in my submission and I found that Classeur was able to pull this off right out of the box.
I think its safe to say that I will be using Classeur more frequently in the future. 

In case you are wondering, here is the submission I made [Link](https://app.classeur.io/#!/files/MMkD3atF0oE1TolRm5Ca).
It took me about an hour to learn Markdown from scratch and make this submission. I wish more companies valued the neatness of presentation along with the correctness of a solution.
