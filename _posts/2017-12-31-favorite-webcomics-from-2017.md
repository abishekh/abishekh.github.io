It's that time of the year folks! The time that I publish my list of favorite webcomics from 2017. I hope you enjoy the list I've taken time to put together.

If you're easily offended, please find the door and yourself on the other side of it. Metaphors are not the same as active assertions or violence/bullying. It's stupid enough that I have to claify this.

1. TheDanemen([https://www.instagram.com/thedanemen/](https://www.instagram.com/thedanemen/))
TheDanemen spotlights David Daneman and his clones in elaborate and hilarious setups that follow some pithy aphorism. It will continually leave you guessing what the next panel might hold and never disappoints. The style is very different and seems like it was drawn up in Flash. This is possibly my favorite comic from 2017.

2. theycantalkcomics([https://www.instagram.com/theycantalkcomics/](https://www.instagram.com/theycantalkcomics/))
Single panel comic. With attention directed towards scene setup and character metaphors. The comics generally revolve around themes of observed realities and poking fun at mundane occurrences. It's really hard to work a good joke into a single panel. Jimmy seems to deliver almost every-time.

3. Shencomix - Previously owlturncomix ([https://www.facebook.com/shencomix/](https://www.facebook.com/shencomix/))
Shen was #2 on my list last year and this year he made it big when the internet dog-piled his retarded take on him losing his bike ([http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/owl-turd-comix](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/owl-turd-comix)). He made some friends through the process too :P. If you like anime/cartoon references and don't like dealing with Mondays - this comic is for you.

4. Toonhole ([http://toonhole.com/](http://toonhole.com/))
The ToonHole series of comics have several creators that regularly contribute their work - this is a good follow if you want to shake things up and get a variation across artists and writers. The comics generally poke fun at social issues, political chatter and pop culture. My personal favorite artist on this comic blog is probably Ryan Kramer (https://www.instagram.com/toonholeryan/).

5. Gudim ([https://www.instagram.com/gudim_public/](https://www.instagram.com/gudim_public/)) A collection of strange two, three and sometimes four panel illustrations. These seem less like comics and more like some surrealist artwork with humor being a second class citizen. There are no dialogues or speech bubbles. It's an acquired taste. The artist Gudim Anton is based in Moscow.

6. Heck if I know ([https://www.instagram.com/cphigson/](https://www.instagram.com/cphigson/))
These comics feature full-color panels - usually 6 or more (so you know the creator has put in a lot of effort). The humor is silly, lose, witty and sometimes morbid. Heck if I know is made by Charlie Higson and in the words of the artist himself - "Lets all try and have a nice day you assholes. "

7. mrs.frollein  ([https://www.instagram.com/mrs.frollein/](https://www.instagram.com/mrs.frollein/))
A young yet not inexperienced comic artist Val√©rie Minelli describes the (non)struggles of her day in relatable, clean(humor) and cheerful ways.Panels are usually limited to 4 or 6 and are inked in grey. If you're in school or early in your career, in a relationship and struggling to make sense of life - this comic is for you. Also she is cool cuz she listens to Tool \m/

8. gwynethdraws ([https://www.instagram.com/gwynethdraws/](https://www.instagram.com/gwynethdraws/))
Another single panel comic - by a Canadian artist. High on puns and poking fun at real world problems.

9. natemorebikes ([https://www.instagram.com/natemorebikes/](https://www.instagram.com/natemorebikes/))
Very retarded and childish humor. I like it because its so random in it's constructs and you end up laughing from the realization that you wasted time reading it. Usually good if you have a hot deadline coming up - in 20 minutes :)) .

10. Sanesparza ([https://www.instagram.com/sanesparza/)](https://www.instagram.com/sanesparza/))
Silly four panel comic that I left out last year since it was too early to judge. The artist does stick to some templates in this comic - the popular ones are the "How to ..." series and the "If X was realistic." series.

11. Antonio F. Branco ([https://www.instagram.com/afbranco2000/](https://www.instagram.com/afbranco2000/))
Political cartoonist from the other side of your fence (yes, you bourgeois liberals). Why? - because I enjoy getting a look at what each side thinks of the other in this spectacle of degeneracy that is known as US politics.

12. Thejoeyalison ([https://www.instagram.com/thejoeyalison/](https://www.instagram.com/thejoeyalison/))
Need more silly conversations and introspection of banal things around the world? Check out lady cartoonist Joey Alison Sayers.

13. Timmeroh ([https://www.instagram.com/timmeroh/](https://www.instagram.com/timmeroh/))
This is also one of those early stage artists that haven't really found a solid rhythm or appeal. The character development consists of talking blob figures most of the time. The artist makes appearances in this comic too.

14. deadfacecomics ([https://www.instagram.com/deadfacecomics/](https://www.instagram.com/deadfacecomics/))
This is a strange one from an artist in New Zealand. I say strange because it seems like the artist is going through some hard times and is finding himself through his work. These panels are generally dark, dreary and not always funny.

15. georgedrawz ([https://www.instagram.com/georgedrawz/ ](https://www.instagram.com/georgedrawz/))
Another four panel comic that seems to be developed around the artist himself - George . The recurring theme here is the setup of expectations and the punch line is usually some bizarre antithesis. (Very vanilla if you ask me.) Nevertheless there are some poignant introspections he makes that can be relatable.

16. Moonbeard ([https://www.instagram.com/squireseses/](https://www.instagram.com/squireseses/))
Moonbeard is mix of quirky, sometimes well balanced and other times overdone humor that mainly revolves around failure as a theme. It's mostly fun - until things get too real.
