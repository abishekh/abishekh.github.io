<p>If you know me, you know how much I love humor and comics. So I’ve decided to make a list and share some of the fun comics that I’ve followed this past year. You can follow them yourself and they will return the favor with laughs and pick you up when you need it - Unless you don’t have a sense of humor, then you can’t be helped - please move along. :</p>
<ol>
<li>Poorly Drawn Lines (<a href="http://poorlydrawnlines.com/">PDL Comics</a>). I met Reza this past year in SF ; he’s a fungi and his comics grow on you. This is my current favorite because very often Reza’s comics contain metaphors for the people he comes across and parallels real-life hilariously.</li>
<li>Owlturd Comix (<a href="http://owlturd.com/">http://owlturd.com/</a>). Silly humor about life and experiences.</li>
<li>übertool (<a href="http://ubertoolcomic.com/">http://ubertoolcomic.com/</a>). The artwork looks like careless scribbles but he gets the laughs going. Checkout #97 that got him a lot of attention this year.</li>
<li>Brooklyn Cartoons (<a href="https://www.brooklyncartoons.com">https://www.brooklyncartoons.com</a>) Everyday trials and tribulations of millennials. Need any more reasons to laugh at/with them ?</li>
<li>Jake likes onions (<a href="http://jakelikesonions.com/">http://jakelikesonions.com/</a>). 4 panel foolery.</li>
<li>War and Peas (<a href="https://warandpeas.com/">https://warandpeas.com/</a>). Their about reads ‘Bounded by fate and an everlasting obsession for carrot cake and alien movies, they roam the streets of their notorious hometown Saarbrücken, Germany.’ Bonus: it has robots - everything is better with robots.</li>
<li>The Gentleman’s Armchair (<a href="http://thegentlemansarmchair.com/">http://thegentlemansarmchair.com/</a>)</li>
<li>Obtuse Engel (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/obtuse_engel/">https://www.instagram.com/obtuse_engel/</a>) A more serious 4 panel, highly economical with words but still manages to convey a lot.</li>
<li>Abstruse Goose (<a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/456">http://abstrusegoose.com/456</a>) Comics for astute thinkers - or some such thing. Some of them get kinda nerdy and you’ll be left puzzled if you don’t have the right mathematical context.</li>
<li>Spiked Math (<a href="http://spikedmath.com/">http://spikedmath.com/</a>) Comics for Math and CS nerds. Some of the concepts are alien to me too - but I end up learning about them to understand the humor.</li>
<li>Sketchshark. (<a href="http://sketchshark.tumblr.com/">http://sketchshark.tumblr.com/</a>) This comic has an unfathomable amount of sass. You have been warned.</li>
<li>Drawing Daily (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/drawingdaily">https://www.facebook.com/drawingdaily</a>)- Steven Kraan. My take is that he comes up with his comics while dropping acid -I can’t see another reasonable explanation.</li>
<li>Liz Climo (<a href="http://lizclimo.tumblr.com/">http://lizclimo.tumblr.com/</a>) - A decent children’s comic. Yea the comics don’t have a name - Liz is the artist.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve not covered the mainstream ones like oatmeal and sarah scribbles since they have enough traction already. Let me know if you have some that you’d like to share or think I’d find funny.</p></div>
